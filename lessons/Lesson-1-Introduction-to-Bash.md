## üìå What is Bash?

**Bash** (Bourne Again SHell) is a command-line shell and scripting language commonly used on Linux and macOS systems. It serves two primary purposes:

* **Interactive Shell**: To run commands manually.
* **Scripting Language**: To automate tasks via scripts.

> Bash is a superset of the original Bourne Shell (`sh`), adding useful features like command history, tab completion, and improved scripting capabilities.

* Automating repetitive system administration tasks.

## üß∞ Basic Shell Concepts

### 1. **Terminal**

The terminal is where you enter commands. Bash is the program interpreting these commands.

You can access the terminal via:

* **macOS**: Terminal app
* **Linux**: Ctrl+Alt+T
* **Windows**: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), Git Bash, or Ubuntu via terminal

### 2. **Command Structure**

```bash
command [options] [arguments]
```

**Example:**

```bash
ls -l /home/user
```

* `ls`: command
* `-l`: option (long format)
* `/home/user`: argument (directory to list)

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"

whoami
```

* `echo`: prints a message
* `pwd`: prints the current working directory
* `whoami`: shows your username
